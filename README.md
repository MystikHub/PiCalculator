# PiCalculator
A calculator that SLOWLY calculates pi through sequences. WARNING! It runs very slowly

To calculate pi it does these calculations:

(4/1) - (4/3) + (4/5) - (4/7) + (4/9) ...

Pretty simple, and that's why it's so slow

This should be not used in a real world environment, but as a small example to demonstrate a straight-forward but inefficient way to calculate pi.
